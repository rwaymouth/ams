### Code Excercise

Setup:
The production files are in the dist folder. To view the site run 
```
php -S localhost:8000
```

The site assumes that you have a database called ams running locally, with a table named 'person', that has the following rows 'lastName', 'firstName', and 'phone'. You can import the ams.sql file into a local db to set this up.
