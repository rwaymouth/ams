### Code Excercise

Setup:
The production files are in the dist folder. To view the site run
```
php -S localhost:8000
```

The site assumes that you have a database running locally. The db should have  a table named 'person', that has the following rows 'lastName', 'firstName', and 'phone'.

You can import the ams.sql file in the dist folder into a local db to set this up.

You can configure your connection by filling in the appropriate information into the `lib/db-settings.php` file.
